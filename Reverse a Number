Write program to reverse a number is discussed here. We can reverse a number using loop and arithmetic operators in both iterative and recursive approaches. 
Input & Output Format:
Input consists of a integer.
Output consists of reversed input.
Sample Input:  13579
Sample Output: 97531

solution:
n=int(input())
rev=0
while n>0:
    r=n%10
    rev=(rev*10)+r
    n=n//10
print(rev)
